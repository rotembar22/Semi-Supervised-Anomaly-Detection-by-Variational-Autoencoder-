## Abstract
Anomaly detection has many applications in security areas and has become an active research issue of great concern in recent years. The purpose of this article is to present an approach for semi-supervised Anomaly detection based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE). VAE is a class of deep generative models trained by maximizing the lower bound of data distribution. This paper demonstrates the potential of using VAE for anomaly detection based on the reconstruction error of the output. Our work focuses on network attacks detection by examining the kddcup99 dataset. We performed several experiments to address our research questions, such as exmine the encoder and decoder size, the latent space dimension, and adding weight to each component in the loss function. The model presents Accuracy results of 85-98%.
